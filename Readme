This is a simple restful get method call spring boot (MicroService) application. 
1. Check out the application and Run the 'CsvParserApplication' as java application. It should bring up the in local  container. 
2. You can use below service call to test the service in any 'restful client' (Advanced restful client or postman)
Eg:
http://localhost:8080/csvParser/parseString/"Patient Name","SSN","Age","Phone Number","Status" "Prescott, Zeke","542-51-6641",21,"801-555-2134","Opratory=2,PCP=1" "Goldstein, Bucky","635-45-1254",42,"435-555-1541","Opratory=1,PCP=1" "Vox, Bono","414-45-1475",51,"801-555-2100","Opratory=3,PCP=2"

3. I didn't intentionally placed any log statements. But created simple test case to test functionality of logic.
